# To get started type 'test-' and select the template you want to use.
# YAML uses backslash as its escape character and eats the first layer of quote marks.
# Use Double Quotes around values containing '$' or '{'.

# To reference a property, use this syntax: 
# without groovy - value: "${PROPERTY_CODE}"
#    with groovy - value: "PROPERTY_CODE" 

# To reference a secure property on the deploy target group and hide the value from the UI, use this syntax: 
# without groovy - value: "\\$${FD_INSTANCE_CODE}_PROPERTY_CODE"
